    "## Detecting Russian Twitter Bots\n",
    "\n",
    "### By: Matt Emmons and Edgar Khachatryan\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find a data source, write/use a tool that gathers up some data (e.g. scrapes twitter or uses a google API)\n",
    "* Prepare somewhere between ½ and 1 page of a description of what your data is, and a simple hypotheses on why this might have something interesting we can do with it\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this dataset is to explore the tweets of certain known Russian twitter 'trolls' and bots to explore the keywords, frequency of tweets and certain tendencies. These accounts often feign as being pro-right American individuals but often have highly coordinated agendas, the goal being to spread information or disinformation amongst other users on social media. The platform we are focused on will be twitter for its ease of use in scraping the relevant tweets from known deviant users. Interestingly, Twitter itself released a new set of statistics regarding their own internal investigation into Russian efforts to influence the 2016 Presidential election revealing that more than 50,000 automated accounts have links to Russian government ministries and Russia-linked organizations, specifically the IRA (Internet Research Agency).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data being used will mainly be individual from users who commonly participate in online discourse surrounding American politics, with focus on talking points and hashtags that are related to current affairs. Twitter's API provides user-controlled geolocation information and date-times of all tweets involved, included lists of users who liked, retweets and responded to questionable posts. This dataset can continually be expanded as long as Twitter's ratelimiting is not exceeded, but for now the dataset will remain small for prototyping techniques at identifying trends. "

# Instructions

To start, register for an API key at [apps.twitter.com](apps.twitter.com), there is a helpful guide here: [http://social-metrics.org/api-keys/](http://social-metrics.org/api-keys/).

Create a file in the base directory called _config.py_ containing (filling in your consumer key and consumer secret key from [apps.twitter.com](apps.twitter.com)):
```
APP_KEY = 'your app key'
APP_SECRET = 'your app secret'
```

Do not share the secret key with anyone!

Finally, run `pip install twython` and you're good to go!
